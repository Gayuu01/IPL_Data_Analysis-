## INSIGHTS:-
1. Winning Trends & Team Performance
- Some teams have a consistently higher win percentage across seasons.
- Home teams often have a slight advantage, but some teams perform equally well in away matches.
- Certain teams dominate head-to-head matchups (e.g., MI vs. KKR, CSK vs. RCB).

2. Toss & Match Outcome
- Winning the toss does not always guarantee a win, but some teams prefer batting or bowling first based on past success.
- In some stadiums, teams chasing a target win more often than teams setting a target.

3. Batsman & Bowler Performance
- Some batsmen perform exceptionally well in pressure situations (death overs).
- Certain players have a strong record against specific bowlers or teams.
- Spinners tend to be more effective in slower pitches (like Chennai or Delhi).

4. High-Scoring & Low-Scoring Venues
- Stadiums like Wankhede and Chinnaswamy often have high-scoring matches.
- Some venues favor bowlers due to pitch conditions, leading to lower average scores.

5. Man of the Match Patterns
- Players scoring 50+ runs or taking 3+ wickets are more likely to win the Man of the Match award.
- All-rounders often have a higher chance of winning these awards.
